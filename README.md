MyNotesApp is a versatile and interactive Android application designed to help users manage their shopping lists efficiently. The core functionality is defined in the ShoppingListMainFuntion composable, which handles the main logic of adding, editing, and deleting shopping items. Users can add new items to their shopping list by clicking the "Add Item" button, which triggers an alert dialog for inputting item details. Each item in the list can be edited or deleted through intuitive UI elements. The app uses Jetpack Compose to provide a modern, responsive interface with smooth interactions. The ShoppingListView composable displays individual items with options to edit or delete them, while the ShoppingItemEditView composable allows for in-place editing of item details. The state management within the app is handled using mutableStateOf to ensure real-time updates and a seamless user experience.
